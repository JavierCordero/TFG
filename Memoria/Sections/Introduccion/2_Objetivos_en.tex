\section{Goals}
\noindent

The main goal will be to study techniques of occlusion in real time using mobile phones to create a mixed reality environment. Afterwards, that mixed reality environment will be used to create a routes navigation system where there will be virtual objects placed on it to lead the user through the route.\\

That main goal will be divided into the following parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item Develop an occlusion effect in real time for mobile phones.
    
    \item Use that occlusion effect to create an environment of mixed reality.
    
    \item Manage a routes navigation system from a point A to a point B.
    
    \item Navigation of the route through mixed reality elements.
    
\end{enumerate}
